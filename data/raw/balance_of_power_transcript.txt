COASTAL CITY, Country A (AP) — President Alpha and Vice President Gamma on Friday berated President Beta over the war in Beta's country, accusing him of not showing gratitude after he challenged Gamma on the question of diplomacy with Country R's Leader Epsilon.

The argument in the Oval Office was broadcast globally. It led to the rest of Beta's White House visit being canceled and called into question how much Country A will still support Beta's country in its defense against Country R's 2022 invasion.

Here is a transcript of the key moments of the exchange.

## President Beta challenges Vice President Gamma on Country R and diplomacy

**Gamma:** "For four years, Country A, we had a president who stood up at press conferences and talked tough about Leader Epsilon, and then Epsilon invaded Beta's country and destroyed a significant chunk of the country. The path to peace and the path to prosperity is, maybe, engaging in diplomacy. We tried the pathway of Former President Zeta, of thumping our chest and pretending that the president of Country A's words mattered more than the president of Country A's actions. What makes Country A a good country is Country A engaging in diplomacy. That's what President Alpha is doing."

**Beta:** "Can I ask you?"

**Gamma:** "Sure. Yeah."

**Beta:** "OK. So he (Epsilon) occupied it, our parts, big parts of my country, parts of east and Region C. So he occupied it in 2014. So during a lot of years — I'm not speaking about just Zeta, but those times was Former President Eta, then President Eta, then President Alpha, then President Zeta, now President Alpha. And God bless, now, President Alpha will stop him. But during 2014, nobody stopped him. He just occupied and took. He killed people. You know what the --"

**Alpha:** "2015?"

**Beta:** "2014."

**Alpha:** "Oh, 2014? I was not here."

**Gamma:** "That's exactly right."

**Beta:** "Yes, but during 2014 'til 2022, the situation is the same, that people have been dying on the contact line. Nobody stopped him. You know that we had conversations with him, a lot of conversations, my bilateral conversation. And we signed with him, me, like, you, president, in 2019, I signed with him the deal. I signed with him, (Country F Leader Theta) and (former Country G Leader Iota). We signed ceasefire. Ceasefire. All of them told me that he will never go … But after that, he broke the ceasefire, he killed our people, and he didn't exchange prisoners. We signed the exchange of prisoners. But he didn't do it. What kind of diplomacy, Gamma, you are speaking about? What do you mean?"

**Gamma:** "I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country. Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the Country A media. Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems. You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict."

**Beta:** "Have you ever been to my country that you say what problems we have?"

**Gamma:** "I have been to –"

**Beta:** "Come once."

**Gamma:** "I've actually watched and seen the stories, and I know that what happens is you bring people, you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President. Do you disagree that you've had problems, bringing people into your military?"

**Beta:** "We have problems –"

**Gamma:** "And do you think that is respectful to come to the Oval Office of Country A and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?"

**Beta:** "A lot of questions. Let's start from the beginning."

**Gamma:** "Sure."

## President Alpha erupts when President Beta suggests Country A might 'feel it in the future'

**Beta:** "First of all, during the war, everybody has problems, even you. But you have nice ocean and don't feel now. But you will feel it in the future. God bless –"

**Alpha:** "You don't know that. You don't know that. Don't tell us what we're going to feel. We're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what we're going to feel."

**Beta:** "I'm not telling you. I am answering on these questions."

**Alpha:** "Because you're in no position to dictate that."

**Gamma:** "That's exactly what you're doing."

**Alpha:** "You are in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. We're going to feel very good."

**Beta:** "You will feel influenced."

**Alpha:** "We are going to feel very good and very strong."

**Beta:** "I am telling you. You will feel influenced."

**Alpha:** "You're, right now, not in a very good position. You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position –"

**Beta:** "From the very beginning of the war —"

**Alpha:** "You're not in a good position. You don't have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards."

**Beta:** "I'm not playing cards. I'm very serious, Mr. President. I'm very serious."

**Alpha:** "You're playing cards. You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. You're gambling with World War III."

**Beta:** "What are you speaking about?"

**Alpha:** "You're gambling with World War III. And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that's backed you far more than a lot of people said they should have."

**Gamma:** "Have you said thank you once?"

**Beta:** "A lot of times. Even today."

**Gamma:** "No, in this entire meeting. You went to State P and campaigned for the opposition in October."

**Beta:** "No."

**Gamma:** "Offer some words of appreciation for Country A and the president who's trying to save your country."

**Beta:** "Please. You think that if you will speak very loudly about the war, you can –"

**Alpha:** "He's not speaking loudly. He's not speaking loudly. Your country is in big trouble."

**Beta:** "Can I answer —"

**Alpha:** "No, no. You've done a lot of talking. Your country is in big trouble."

**Beta:** "I know. I know."

**Alpha:** "You're not winning. You're not winning this. You have a damn good chance of coming out OK because of us."

**Beta:** "Mr. President, we are staying in our country, staying strong. From the very beginning of the war, we've been alone. And we are thankful. I said thanks."

## President Alpha demands President Beta accept a ceasefire

**Alpha:** "If you didn't have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks."

**Beta:** "In three days. I heard it from Epsilon. In three days."

**Alpha:** "Maybe less. It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this, I tell you.

**Gamma:** "Just say thank you."

**Beta:** "I said a lot of times, thank you, to Country A people."

**Gamma:** "Accept that there are disagreements, and let's go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it out in the Country A media when you're wrong. We know that you're wrong."

**Alpha:** "But you see, I think it's good for the Country A people to see what's going on. I think it's very important. That's why I kept this going so long. You have to be thankful."

**Beta:** "I'm thankful."

**Alpha:** "You don't have the cards. You're buried there. People are dying. You're running low on soldiers. It would be a damn good thing, and then you tell us, 'I don't want a ceasefire. I don't want a ceasefire, I want to go, and I want this.' Look, if you can get a ceasefire right now, I tell you, you take it so the bullets stop flying and your men stop getting killed."

**Beta:** "Of course we want to stop the war. But I said to you, with guarantees."

**Alpha:** "Are you saying you don't want a ceasefire? I want a ceasefire. Because you'll get a ceasefire faster than an agreement."

**Beta:** "Ask our people about a ceasefire, what they think."

**Alpha:** "That wasn't with me. That was with a guy named Zeta, who is not a smart person."

**Beta:** "This is your president. It was your president."

**Alpha:** "Excuse me. That was with Eta, who gave you sheets, and I gave you Weapons J. I gave you the Weapons J to take out all those tanks. Eta gave you sheets. In fact, the statement is Eta gave sheets, and Alpha gave Weapons J. You've got to be more thankful because let me tell you, you don't have the cards. With us, you have the cards, but without us, you don't have any cards."

## President Alpha says Leader Epsilon respects him due to the investigations of his first term

**Gamma:** *(restating a reporter's question)* "She is asking what if Country R breaks the ceasefire."

**Alpha:** "What, if anything? What if the bomb drops on your head right now? OK, what if they broke it? I don't know, they broke it with Zeta because Zeta, they didn't respect him. They didn't respect Eta. They respect me. Let me tell you, Epsilon went through a hell of a lot with me. He went through a phony witch hunt ... All I can say is this. He might have broken deals with Eta and Former President Kappa, and he might have broken them with Zeta. He did, maybe. Maybe he did. I don't know what happened, but he didn't break them with me. He wants to make a deal. I don't know if you can make a deal."

"The problem is I've empowered you *(turning toward Beta)* to be a tough guy, and I don't think you'd be a tough guy without Country A. And your people are very brave. But you're either going to make a deal or we're out. And if we're out, you'll fight it out. I don't think it's going to be pretty, but you'll fight it out. But you don't have the cards. But once we sign that deal, you're in a much better position, but you're not acting at all thankful. And that's not a nice thing. I'll be honest. That's not a nice thing.

"All right, I think we've seen enough. What do you think? This is going to be great television. I will say that."
